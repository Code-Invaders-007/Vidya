Problem Statement: We live in an era of information , which is too abundant to consume with immense options available, which creates a lot of ambiguity
When the world has transformed for a digital curriculum, when everyone started appreciating the pros that were promised to be delivered within one's comfort zone , the abundance in the data didn't serve the very purpose that it was designed for.


These were some of the issues that we identified:

1. A lot of time is involved in finding relevant information that we are in search of.
2. The need to visit multiple websites in order to gather all necessary information is also a time-consuming and frustrating process.
3. The main issue is a lack of personal guidance in the learning process. Without the presence of a teacher or mentor, it can be difficult for the individual to stay on track. Our system will give the company throughout the learning process, which can provide input and guidance, which would help make the experience more effective, as it would be similar to in-person learning.
